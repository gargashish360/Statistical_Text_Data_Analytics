This readme contains the description of notebooks present inside the repository. This section focuses on different text data analytics methods and their implementation.


# MultivariateGaussianDistribution.ipynb: 

This shows the functionality to create MultivariateGaussianDistribution.

# Checking_Document_Similarity_Using_Cosines.ipynb: 

This notebook shows the functionality of checking the similarity of the query with the stored documents. It uses the TFIDF matrix to calculate the document features and then cosine similarity to check the similarity. In the code d1, d2, d3 and d4 are the documents to which specified query will be matched.
